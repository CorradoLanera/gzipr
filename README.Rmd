The goal of gzipr is to implement a generalized R version for the "Less is More: Parameter-Free Text Classification with Gzip" by Zhiying Jiang, Matthew Y.R. Yang, Mikhail Tsirlin, Raphael Tang, Jimmy Lin (https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09410) that works for tabular data, text data, and general lists of arbitrary (structured similar) observations.


Citing the original paper abstract:

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are often used
for text classification tasks as they usually achieve high levels of
accuracy. However, DNNs can be computationally intensive with
billions of parameters and large amounts of labeled data, which can
make them expensive to use, to optimize and to transfer to
out-of-distribution (OOD) cases in practice. In this paper, we
propose a non-parametric alternative to DNNs that's easy,
light-weight and universal in text classification: a combination of a
simple compressor like gzip with a k-nearest-neighbor classifier.
Without any training, pre-training or fine-tuning, our method
achieves results that are competitive with non-pretrained deep
learning methods on six in-distributed datasets. It even outperforms
BERT on all five OOD datasets, including four low-resource languages.
Our method also performs particularly well in few-shot settings where
labeled data are too scarce for DNNs to achieve a satisfying
accuracy.



## Features

- `{gzipr}` works with data frames, lists, and text data.


## Installation

You can install the development version of `{gzipr}` like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CorradoLanera/gzipr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(gzipr)

## tabular data
train <- mtcars[1:20, ]
test <- mtcars[21:32, ]

train_x <- train[, -2]
train_y <- train[[2]]

test_x <- test[, -2]
test_y <- test[[2]]

model <- gzipr(train_x, train_y)
result <- predict(model, test_x)

# accuracy
mean(result == test_y)


## Text data
train_text_x <-  c(
  "I love to play football",
  "Basketball is my favorite sport",
  "Football is amazing",
  "Basketball rules"
)

train_text_y <- c(
  "A",
  "B",
  "A",
  "B"
)

test_text_x <- c("I enjoy football", "Basketball is the best")

model_text <- gzipr(train_text_x, train_text_y)
res_text <- predict(model_text, test_text_x)
res_text
```
